            <h3>About Cymbal Shops</h3>
            <p>Cymbal Shops is an American retail chain headquartered in Minneapolis that sells homewares, electronics, and clothing. Founded in 1974, Cymbal Shops started out as Cymbal Air, selling AC systems manufactured by Cymbal Group in Minnesota and neighboring states. The company quickly expanded into domestic merchandise to satisfy the need for quality products at an affordable price in the midst of a recession.</p>
            <p>Cymbal Shops' broad product assortment was once a benefitâ€”capturing planned purchases and last-minute splurges. In recent years, however, the company has struggled to adapt to the acceleration in e-commerce. Digitally native companies are on the rise, and Cymbal Shops must implement significant changes to keep pace and maintain relevance. Today, Cymbal Shops operates 714 stores across North America and reported $15 billion in revenue in 2019. They currently employ 80,400 employees across the United States and Canada.</p>
